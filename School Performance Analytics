# 📊 School Performance Analytics – Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Power BI analytics solution** designed for a fictional secondary school with 1,000 students across Forms 1–4.  
It provides actionable insights for:
- **Headmaster** → whole school performance
- **Heads of Departments (HODs)** → subject benchmarking
- **Class Teachers** → class-level monitoring
- **Parents & Students** → individual academic profiles

👉 The solution demonstrates how **student marks, grades, and attendance data** can be transformed into a professional, interactive dashboard for decision-making.

## 🗂️ Data Model
Two synthetic datasets were created:

1. **Scores Dataset**  
   - Core subjects: Mathematics, English, Shona, History, Science, Geography  
   - Stream-specific subjects: Commerce, Literature, Physics, etc.  
   - Practical subjects: Computer Science, Fashion & Fabrics, etc.  
   - Grading system:  
     - A = 80+  
     - B = 70–79  
     - C = 60–69  
     - D = 50–59  
     - E = 40–49  
     - F < 40  

   Extra: **Grade Points (1–6)** assigned to each grade to compute GPA-like averages.

2. **Attendance Dataset**  
   - 90 days (3 months) daily records  
   - Status = Present / Absent / Late  
   - Linked to Students via `Student ID`

## 🧮 Key Metrics
- **Pass/Fail Rule** → Students with 5+ Cs are considered to have passed.  
- **Grade Point Average (GPA)** → Quality measure of passes.  
- **Pass Rate %** → % of students meeting the 5C+ benchmark.  
- **Subject vs School Gap** → How each subject compares to school average.  
- **Attendance Rate %** → Student engagement metric.

## 📊 Dashboard Walkthrough

### 📍 Page 1 – School Overview (Headmaster)
**Visuals:**
- KPI Cards → Pass Rate %, School GPA, Top & Weakest Subject
- Scatter Plot → Class Pass Rate % vs Class GPA
- Heatmap → Subjects × Classes with average GPA
- Grade Distribution → School-wide count of A–F

**Sample Insight:**  
> School GPA is 2.74 (average of D), with an 62.6% pass rate. Ndebele leads with GPA 3.6, while Science lags at 3.2. Class 3B has a high pass rate but low GPA → many borderline passes.

---

### 📍 Page 2 – Class Dashboard (Teachers)
**Visuals:**
- Class KPIs → Pass Rate %, GPA, Top & Bottom Student
- Student Ranking Table → Names, GPA, Pass/Fail, Rank
- Bar Chart → Student GPAs in descending order
- Grade Distribution → Spread of A–F within the class

**Sample Insight:**  
> Form 2C GPA is 3.2 with 63.8% pass rate. Top student “Tariro M. (5.8 GPA)” excels, while “Student X (2.5 GPA)” needs intervention. Most grades are clustered at C.

---

### 📍 Page 3 – Subject Dashboard (HODs)
**Visuals:**
- KPI Cards → Subject GPA, School GPA, Gap to School, Pass Rate %
- Grade Distribution → A–F breakdown for subject
- Bar Chart → Classes vs Subject GPA
- Top 10 Students Table → Best performers in subject

**Sample Insight:**  
> Mathematics GPA is 3.4 (below school avg. 3.9), with a pass rate of 76%. Class 4A performs strongest (4.6), while Class 2B struggles (2.9). Focus interventions on Form 2 early.

---

### 📍 Page 4 – Student Profile (Drillthrough)
**Visuals:**
- Info Card → Name, Class, GPA, Rank, Pass/Fail, Attendance %
- Radar Chart → GPA across all subjects
- Bar Chart → Subject-wise GPA
- Line Chart → Attendance trend over 3 months

---

## 🎯 Key KPIs
- **Pass Rate %** → How many students meet the 5C+ rule  
- **Average GPA** → Quality of grades beyond simple pass/fail  
- **Benchmark Gap** → Subject GPA vs School GPA  
- **Attendance Rate %** → Correlation between presence and performance  

---

## 📈 Strategic Value
- **Headmaster** → School-wide decision-making  
- **HODs** → Identify weak subjects & classes to target  
- **Teachers** → Monitor class performance & support weaker students  
- **Parents/Students** → Personalized performance and attendance profiles  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Automate refresh from exam & attendance systems  
- Add continuous assessment & behavioral records  
- Deploy via Power BI Service with role-based dashboards
